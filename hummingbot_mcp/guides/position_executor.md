### Position Executor
Takes directional positions with defined entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.

**Use when:**
- You have a clear directional view (bullish/bearish)
- You want automated stop-loss and take-profit management
- You want to define risk/reward ratios upfront

**Avoid when:**
- You want to provide liquidity (use Market Making instead)
- You need complex multi-leg strategies
